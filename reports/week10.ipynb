    "# 3D Skeleton Visualization System: Sprint 10 Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the implementation of a 3D skeleton visualization system for comparing ground truth and predicted skeletal poses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is composed of several React components working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CSVPrediction** - The main container component that handles file uploading, data processing, and state management\n",
    "2. **PoseNet3DVisualization** - Orchestrates the visualization components and manages display modes\n",
    "3. **SkeletonRenderer** - Core Three.js component that renders 3D skeletons with rotation capabilities\n",
    "4. **SkeletonContext & Provider** - Context API implementation for sharing state across components\n",
    "5. **SkeletonControls** - UI controls for animation playback and view options\n",
    "6. **AnimationManager** - Handles animation timing and frame synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Component Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. CSVPrediction Component\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main entry point component that handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Management**: CSV uploads via drag-and-drop or file selection\n",
    "- **Backend Integration**: Loading sample ground truth data from the server\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Parsing CSV files with automatic delimiter detection\n",
    "- **State Management**: Tracking data state, UI state, and visualization modes\n",
    "- **UI Rendering**: Tab-based interface for data and visualization views\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive delimiter detection (comma or tab-separated values)\n",
    "- Progress indication during file processing\n",
    "- Data preview with Z-value highlighting\n",
    "- Tab-based interface switching between data view and 3D visualization\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example of CSV data processing function\n",
    "const processCSV = async (file: File) => {\n",
    "  // Read file content\n",
    "  const text = await file.text();\n",
    "  const lines = text.split(\"\\n\");\n",

    "   - Converts numeric values automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Structure**:\n",
    "   - Each frame becomes an object with properties for each joint coordinate\n",
    "   - Properties follow the naming convention: `[joint_name]_[x|y|z]`\n",
    "   - Z-values are optional and handled appropriately when present\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation**:\n",
    "   - Checks for required coordinates and proper formatting\n",
    "   - Validates joint structure consistency across frames\n",
    "   - Provides feedback for missing or invalid data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three.js Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D rendering utilizes Three.js with these key techniques:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Tab-Based Navigation**:\n",
    "   - Data view for uploading and previewing CSV files\n",
    "   - 3D view for visualization and interaction\n",
    "   - Seamless transition between views\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Upload Experience**:\n",
    "   - Drag-and-drop support with visual feedback\n",
    "   - File selection alternative via dialog\n",

    "   - Playback controls with speed adjustment\n",
    "   - Frame-by-frame navigation via slider\n",
    "   - Auto-rotation for better spatial perception\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visual Feedback**:\n",
    "   - Color-coded skeletons (blue for ground truth, red for prediction)\n",
    "   - In-scene legend explaining the color scheme\n",
    "   - Labels for clear identification\n",
    "   - Error alerts for invalid data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User loads the application and sees the data tab\n",
    "2. They either upload a CSV file or load sample data\n",
    "3. The system processes the file and displays a preview\n",
    "4. User switches to the 3D view tab to see the visualization\n",
    "5. They can toggle between side-by-side and overlapping views\n",
    "6. Animation controls allow them to play through the frames\n",
    "7. Auto-rotation can be enabled for better spatial understanding\n",
    "8. Frame by frame examination is possible via the slider\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D Skeleton Visualization System provides a solution for comparing ground truth and predicted skeletal poses. By leveraging Three.js for rendering and React for UI/state management."
