    "# PoseNet Capture System - Sprint Report (Week 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint focused on implementing a complete pose detection and data management system using TensorFlow.js and PoseNet on the frontend, with a FastAPI backend for data storage. We successfully completed the core capture functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "### PoseNet Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully implemented real-time human pose detection using TensorFlow.js and the PoseNet model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Configuration**: We selected the MobileNetV1 architecture with optimized parameters for web performance, balancing accuracy with speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time Processing**: The system captures frames from the webcam and processes them through PoseNet in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keypoint Detection**: For each frame, PoseNet identifies 17 key body joints (nose, eyes, ears, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles) with their coordinates and confidence scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Animation Loop**: We implemented an efficient frame capture system using `requestAnimationFrame` that synchronizes with the browser's refresh rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Each detected pose is timestamped and stored, creating a complete motion capture dataset during recording sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Export Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented two export options for flexibility in downstream analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON Export:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON export creates a structured data file that preserves the complete hierarchical nature of the pose data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When activated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The system validates that pose data has been captured\n",
    "2. Converts the pose array to a formatted JSON string\n",
    "3. Creates a downloadable file with a timestamp in the filename\n",
    "4. Triggers a browser download without server interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSV Export:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV export provides compatibility with spreadsheet applications and data analysis tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creates column headers for timestamp and each body part (with x, y, and confidence)\n",
    "2. Transforms the hierarchical pose data into a flattened tabular format\n",
    "3. Creates a properly formatted CSV file and triggers download\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Upload Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented data uploading to the backend server. The system specifically uses JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upload process works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Validation**: First checks if poses have been captured\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**: Converts pose array to JSON and creates a properly named file\n",
    "3. **Transmission**: Uses FormData and multipart/form-data for reliable file upload\n",
    "4. **Response Handling**: Processes server response to show success or detailed error messages\n",
    "5. **State Management**: Updates UI appropriately when upload completes or fails\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend \n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a dedicated endpoint for receiving and storing PoseNet data in our FastAPI backend. The endpoint follows RESTful principles and implements several important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upload Endpoint Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `/upload-posenet-data` endpoint processes incoming pose data files with the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Reception**: Uses FastAPI's efficient file handling to receive multipart uploads\n",
    "2. **Format Validation**: Ensures only JSON files are accepted, preventing format mismatches\n",
    "3. **Storage Management**: Creates a dedicated directory structure for organized data storage\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Implements error management with specific error types\n",
    "5. **Response Formatting**: Returns clear success/error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This endpoint completes the capture-to-storage pipeline, allowing pose data to be permanently stored for later analysis or training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Challenges Overcome\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Frame Rate Optimization**: We successfully balanced pose detection accuracy with performance by fine-tuning PoseNet parameters. The MobileNetV1 architecture with a multiplier of 0.75 provided the best balance between accuracy and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Animation Loop Management**: We implemented a frame capture system using requestAnimationFrame that properly synchronizes with browser refresh cycles and efficiently handles cleanup to prevent memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Cleanup**: We created proper cleanup mechanisms for webcam streams and canvas contexts when components unmount or when capture stops, ensuring no orphaned processes remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error State Recovery**: The system gracefully handles and recovers from various error conditions including camera permission denials, model loading failures, and network issues during uploads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment Challenges: SSL and Cross-Origin Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "We encountered some deployment challenges related to secure connections when hosting the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The HTTPS/Camera Access Dilemma:**\n",
    "- Modern browsers require HTTPS for accessing device cameras\n",
    "- Without a domain name, generating a trusted SSL certificate for our server IP was problematic\n",
    "- This prevented the application from accessing webcams when hosted directly on our server\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Protocol Communication Issues:**\n",
    "- We attempted to host the frontend on Vercel (with automatic HTTPS)\n",
    "- However, our backend remained on HTTP only (being hosted on an IP without a domain)\n",
    "- Browsers block mixed-content requests from HTTPS frontends to HTTP backends\n",
    "- This prevented our securely-hosted frontend from communicating with our backend\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Purchase a domain name and configure proper SSL certificates for both services\n",
    "2. Generate self-signed certificates (though these trigger browser warnings)\n",
    "3. Use a reverse proxy with a properly secured domain to handle both frontend and backend traffic\n",
    "4. For immediate demonstration purposes, run the frontend locally where HTTPS is not enforced for localhost\n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, we've opted to demonstrate the application directly from development machines until a proper domain and SSL setup can be implemented in the production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment Status\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is currently deployed with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frontend**: Hosted on Vercel at https://deepfe.vercel.app/\n",
    "- **Backend**: Hosted on a server with IP-only access (no domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Limitations:**\n",
    "- When accessing the application at https://deepfe.vercel.app/, users can utilize all webcam capture and export functionalities\n",
    "- However, the \"Upload to Server\" feature is non-functional from this URL due to mixed content restrictions (HTTPS frontend cannot communicate with HTTP backend)\n",
    "- For complete functionality including uploads, the application must be run locally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Instructions:**\n",
    "- To test the application's core pose detection and export features, visit https://deepfe.vercel.app/\n",
    "- Export to JSON and CSV will work correctly\n",
    "- For development and testing of the full feature set including uploads, use the local development environment for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint successfully delivered a complete pose detection system with seamless data capture, export, and storage capabilities. "
