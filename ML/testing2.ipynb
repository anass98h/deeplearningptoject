Our approach predicts the 13 Z-values (one per joint) for the last frame in each window and compares different neural network types, including dense ,cnn,gru, to see which one works best.\n",

    "Build TensorFlow/Keras models with hidden layers activated by ReLU and a linear output layer to predict raw Z-values. Use the Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error as the loss function, and track Mean Absolute Error as an extra performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training & Evaluation:\n",
    "Use 10-fold cross-validation by splitting sequences into folds. Apply early stopping to avoid overfitting and use model checkpointing to save the best weights. Perform a grid search over key hyperparameters (window size, learning rate, architecture type, number of layers, and units per layer) and log the performance results to a CSV file for analysis."
